## OVERVIEW üö†

I have created a fully function pizza ordering system to meet the needs of customers for a real pizza service, Nags With Notions. You can find their website here, which I also created as part of my PP1 requirements and is now online: [Nags With Notions](nagswithnotions.ie). The main function of the system is to allow customers to purchase items through the Nags with Notions website. Additionally, order information is updated to a spreadsheet, so Nags With Notions can make more informed decisions regarding the amount of product they require and can also keep users up-to-date on what's available. The program was created entirely using Python and the intention was to keep all aspects of the design in line with the Nags with Notions style. 

The [Live Site](https://pizza-ordering-system-b873de0bec0c.herokuapp.com/) is fully accessible on Heroku. 

## UX/UI

### STRATEGY

#### Goals ü•Ö<br> 

* To create a Pizza ordering system that allows users to order their pizzas online
* It should improve customer experience and reduce staff workload by not having to take phone orders.
* It will also reduce queue sizes.
* This system will increase customer satisfaction by providing a detailed confirmation of the order.
* Nags with Notions aims to increase its sales by providing customers with an online ordering system where they can see the options on offer. 

#### User Stories üìñ<br>

* I want to be able to easily browse the menu and select the pizzas I want.
* I want to be able to see the prices of the pizzas on offer
* I want to be given a warning if I've entered something incorrectly.
* I want a cart displayed that updates the price and items, as I add to it
* I want a reference number for my order and the total price at the end.
* I want to know roughly how long I need to wait for my order. 

### SCOPE üî≠<br>

The following features have been planned:

* Information about the current pizzas and their prices will be taken from a 
spreadsheet and presented to the user
* Users can select any pizzas, up to a maximum of ten
* The program will display warnings if the user has chosen too many pizzas
or the input they have provided isn't correct
* The user options will be presented on-screen
* The user will be updated on their current purchases and the exact overall price
* The user will be asked to proceed to checkout or continue updating their order
* A program will estimate the likely cooking time
* The user will receive a unique receipt
* Information will be presented neatly in tables/lists

### STRUCTURE‚ò†<br> 

This [Project Wireframe](./assets/images/readme_images/pizza_order_system_wireframe.pdf) 
shows the overall structure of the program. It was written using Python. The terminal was
created using the Code Institute template. All the coding can be found in run.py; which is
found on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/JWalshe86).


### FLOWCHARTS üìà<br>

![Project Flow Chart](/assets/images/readme_images/features_images/flow_chart.png)

### SURFACE/DESIGN<br>

Each page contains information to inform the user about the pizzas on offer and let them
decide what they would like. Each page leads into the next and culminates with a final display
message showing the user's purchase, overall cost, estimated wait time, and a unique reference number.

## FEATURES

### EXISTING FEATURES

The program was designed primarily to help the user but elements can help the client [nagswithnotions](nagswithnotions.ie). To give real data to the client, the system is linked to
a Google Spreadsheet: [Pizza Order Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14eg7Jg65BIRgRaMwWoeuFZHibci230T1KNaDBDSYRrE/edit#gid=819050592)

## TESTING üß™

[Pylint Actions 261023](./Pylint_actions261023.pdf)
[Pylint Actions 051123](./testing/pylint_report_051123.txt) Your code has been rated
 at 8.35/10 (previous run: 8.35/10, +0.00)
 * The global statement for 'initial screen display' has run was left in the code, despite being
<<<<<<< HEAD
 highlighted by Pylint. This is because it appears to work well and I don't know another way to prevent the screen display when the user selects they want to add more items to their order. 081123 This issue 
 was resolved by using the fact that, unlike variables, lists can be manipulated regardless of scope. A 
 list was appended after the initial function was run. Once this lists length was >0 the function didn't
 run again.

>>>>>>> 9bf492dea4518d6c28059afe302d28675f3d631a
 * The code to display the cart items: [print(*x) for x in CART_DISPLAY] has been highlighted by Pylint for not being assigned to a variable. This was temporarily ignored as it's working well and I don't know an alternative. Eventually, thanks to StackOverflow, I found a resolution by using a for loop and " ".join() mapping each item in the nested list to a string with map(). Map was used to manipulate all the items and convert each item to a string which is then joined with " " so each item can be printed on separate lines.
 * The except PizzaException as e was showing as possibly unbound, despite working. By moving the 
 PizzaException class into the global scope this issue was resolved.
 * After addressing the recommendations the Pylint report reads: Your code has been rated at 9.66/10 (previous run: 9.60/10, +0.06). It's just the above two recommendations to address. 
 * [Code Institute Pylinter 051123](./testing/Code_Institute_Pylinter_051123.pdf)
 * [Code Institute Pylinter cleared](./testing/CI_Pylinter_cleared.png)
 * Test run on Heroku 05/11/23. os.system('cls') not recognised by Heroku but os.system('clear') is. Solved with the following if statement: 'os.system('cls' if os.name=='nt' else 'clear')'. I also had to run pyfiglet to my requirement.txt, so Heroku could recognize it as a dependency.

 ### Feature Testing 061123/071123

 All tests took place on the [deployed Heroku site]((https://pizza-ordering-system-b873de0bec0c.herokuapp.com/)) 

  <details><summary>Welcome Banner</summary>
<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/features_images/inital_screen_display.png">
</details>

    * Expected: Upon entering the site expect the Nags with Notions Banner to display in large purple writing for 3 seconds and then disappear. 
    * Outcome: displayed as expected. 

  <details><summary>Menu Display</summary>
<img src="./assets/images/readme_images/features_images/menu_display.png">

## MODULES IMPORTED üëΩ

 * The os module was used for its ability to manipulate the operating system, particularly to clear
 the terminal screen. 
 * The time module was used to complement the os module and delay when items were displayed or 
 lengthen the time an item was displayed.
 * The random module was used to present a random number that could be used for the reference.
 * The Gspread module was used to manipulate Google Sheets.
 * The pyfiglet module was imported to style the Nags with Notions banner.
